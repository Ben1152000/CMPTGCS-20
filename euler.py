Here is a selection of problems from the first page of Project Euler:

You are encouraged to work on these problems either on your own or in small groups.

"""
Problem 2:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, 
we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

"""
Problem 3:

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from 
the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Problem 4:

It is possible to write 5 as a sum in exactly seven different ways:

5
4 + 1
3 + 2
3 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 1
2 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

How many different ways can 100 be written as a sum of positive integers?
